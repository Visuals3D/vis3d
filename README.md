# Visuals3D CLI 


This cli tool is able to generate multiple frequantly used code templates for https://visuals3d.de Microservice based Cloud projects. The goal of this cli is to speed up the development process of new cloud based backend applications. And provide a plug and play development environment.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @visuals3d/vis3d
```



## Run 

### Create Microservice

A Single boilerplate Microservice to built on top of.

```bash
vis3d generate microservice my-mycroservice-name 
```

#### Options

- **-- yes**  => skip promts and use defaults
- **--git** => initialise a git repo for the new service
- **--install** => automatically install npm packages for new service


### Create Service

A internal service inside a microservice to outsource logik inside an api. This must be run in a microservice folder

```bash
vis3d generate service my-service-name 
```

#### Options






## Features:



### Typescript & Express

The base is a expressjs Server with full Typescript support

### Nodemon Hot reload

This Service supports Hot reload in development, even when using docker





### Full Docker support

This Microservice can be run as a docker container both in production and in development





### Visuals Studio Code Attachable Debugger

The service will start with an open port (9229) to attach a debuger to. Default settings for Visuals Studio Code are availible. Just go to the debugging page in vsCode and hit the green Arraw next to the "Attach" selection. The Debugger will be attached and you can set breakpoints etc. 
**Warning** There is an issue right now that prevents the service from running without a attached debugger. So you have to attache a debugger and hit continue to get the service up and running.





### Insomnia Openapi Design and Testing support

The .insomnia folder or a insomnia.yaml file in the root folder is used to edit openapi documentation, create and run tests as well as debug the microservice api. 
This file is also used to autogenerate api schemas and documentation.
This also allows multi repository microservice projects to be developed asynchron against api specifications.





### Insomnia cli support 

insomnia-inso cli support for a better workflow as well as automation for testing a running version of the service against the openapi specifications and run custom tests for ci/cd pipelines.

```bash
npm run test:api
```





### OpenApi Support and autogenerated Typescript Schemas

This Microservice Api is documented via open-api specifications inside a .insomnia folder or a insomnia.yaml file will be used to generate a html documentation of the whole api via 

```bash
npm run docs
```

Also a autogeneration of the full api schema is integrated. Everytime the Hot Reload is triggered the schema will be updated to always provide the newest interfaces.
The schema will be generated into ./models/generated/api/api.schema.ts
It can be triggered manually by

```bash
npm run generate:schema
```





### Unit Testing

Simple Typescript Unit testing is implemented via mocha and chai. The tests have to be written inside the **tests** folder in files with names like *.test.ts. The tests can be run like so:

```bash
npm run test
```



### Test Coverage

Test coverage can be calculated and printed as a list via **nyc**

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

For CI/CD procedures this script call will fail if the test coverage is below 90% everage over all lines



### Typescript Linting

As a typescript linter **eslint** is included and can be called via

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

The **lint:fix** call allows eslint to fix minor problems in the code automatically. This should be used in development and the version without fix is meant for CI/CD pipelines.



### Public Folder

The Service provides a public folder which will be copied into the typescript compile folder to be useable in production.
